The code in the book and this repo has been thoroughly tested. 
If you run into problems, it's usually because the dependencies 
have changed (note: the package.json contains exact dependency matching).

If you do run into problems, please don't hesitate to either:

- file an issue on the repo of the chapter code (the repo link is in the package.json file)
- mail the author (the email address is in the package.json)

I want you to be happy with this purchase, so please let me know
if you run into any problems (rather than just posting a bad review
somewhere, with no option to help or assist).

- Sven
